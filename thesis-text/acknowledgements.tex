\chapter*{Preface}
HELLO THERE!!

Obviously thankful to my promoter, for the interesting talks on a weekly basis.
Encouraging my creativity, find interesting ideas, while being realistic with my ideas and overall guiding me towards a good result.


Thank you to prof Bart Dhoedt from UGent, and Dirk Van Compernolle   from KU Leuven to allow me to attend your courses Deep Generative Models, and Speech recognition, respectively, voluntarily. Both courses have provided me with meaningful insights which resulted in a better overall thesis.

Additionally, I would like to thank Lowe et al. for sharing her work, making youtube videos and also publicly sharing her thesis for the world to see, and her code. I copied her layout.

\chapter*{Preface}

I am proud to say that what lays here in front of you is my Thesis, written with the aim of obtaining my Master's degree in Computer Science specialised in Artificial Intelligence.


As you will see, the thesis relatively mathematically based. However, ironically, I used to be terrible at mathematics and absolutely avoid it as much as I could. This was also the main reason for choosing a professional bachelor's degree in Applied Information Technology, at a college where no mathematics courses were taught. 

However, during this education I became very interested in machine learning. The idea of a teaching a computer to perform an activity without explicitly telling it what to do seemed just very fascinating to me. However, if I wanted to learn more about this, I would need to catch up on all the mathematics courses. This was one of the greatest challenges, I have ever had to go through. However, slowly but surely, concepts became clearer and I even started to enjoy mathematics. Although concepts seemed daunting at first, which initially made me hate them, after learning more more and about and slowly but surely understanding things better, each "aha" moment felt absolutely amazing, making me even like mathematics. I would even say that mathematics is one of my passions. Today, I can proudly say that I have succeeded at this daunting task, and the result is my thesis on Representation Learning with latent space constraints.


However, I would never have gotten this far without the help from all the people surrounding me. In particular, I am truly grateful to have Prof. Dr. Bart de Boer as my promoter. Thank you for the interesting talks, pushing me further and further while ensuring I remained on path towards a concrete topic. I can image this may have been a bit tricky with all the different I came up with, every week suggesting a new topic. Encouraging my creativity, find interesting ideas, while being realistic with my ideas and overall guiding me towards a good result. In addition, I wish to thank Prof. Dr. Bart Dhoedt from UGent, professor of the course Deep Generative Models. Your course and the interesting discussions we had have given me incredible insights which resulted in greater insights in my topic and a better thesis overall. Lastly, I would like to thank the creators of OpenAI. Ironically, this thesis does not only go about AI, it is also partly written by AI. In particular, ChatGPT was used as a fancy grammar checker and contributed to better overall styling. I take full credit for the content and contributions in this work.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
HELLO THERE!!

Obviously thankful to my promoter, for the interesting talks on a weekly basis.
Encouraging my creativity, find interesting ideas, while being realistic with my ideas and overall guiding me towards a good result.


Additionally, I would like to thank Lowe et al. for sharing her work, making youtube videos and also publicly sharing her thesis for the world to see, and her code. I copied her layout.
